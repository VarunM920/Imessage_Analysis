# Imessage_Analysis
In this project, I was curious to find out how my friends reacted in our Imessage groupchat. For those who are not familiar with Imessage reactions, a user can react to
a text sent by another user with a laugh, like, dislike, love, emphasized, or questioned. I specifically wanted to find out who the funniest member in the groupchat
was, so I devised a ranking based on how many laugh reacts a person got over the past year. The two files in the repository contain the methodology I used after extracting
the data from my phone. For an in-depth explanation, check out this youtube video: https://youtu.be/rppdwqWzU3E
